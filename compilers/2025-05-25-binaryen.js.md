# binaryen.js

Binaryen is a compiler and toolchain infrastructure library for WebAssembly, written in C++. One of the main use cases is as a Wasm-to-Wasm optimizer: if you have a compiler that produces WebAssembly, you can use Binaryen to optimize the module for size and performance.

What I didn't know is that there's also a [JS API](https://github.com/WebAssembly/binaryen/wiki/binaryen.js-API) and an [npm package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/binaryen). It's used by AssemblyScript, among others.

Here's an example of how to use it:

```js
import binaryen from "binaryen";

const mod = new binaryen.Module();

mod.addFunction(
  "add",
  binaryen.createType([binaryen.i32, binaryen.i32]),
  binaryen.i32,
  [binaryen.i32],
  mod.block(null, [
    mod.local.set(
      2,
      mod.i32.add(
        mod.local.get(0, binaryen.i32),
        mod.local.get(1, binaryen.i32),
      ),
    ),
    mod.return(mod.local.get(2, binaryen.i32)),
  ]),
);
mod.addFunctionExport("add", "add");
mod.optimize();

const wasmData = mod.emitBinary();
```

Unfortunately, the full package is quite big â€” the bundle that rollup produced for me was 9MB.
