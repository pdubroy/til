# Data race

Yesterday I was talking with [David Albert](https://twitter.com/davidbalbert) about data race safety in Swift 6, and it occurred to me that I didn't actually know what the precise definition of a _data race_ was.

According to [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Race_condition#Data_race), the precise definition can differ depending on the language and the formal concurrency model. But, the high level definitions are pretty similar:

> when multiple threads access the same memory without synchronization, and at least one access is a write.

(From the [Apple Developer documentation on data races](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/xcode/data-races).)

Here are the definitions for some other languages:

[Java](https://docs.oracle.com/cd/E19205-01/820-0619/geojs/index.html):

> A data race occurs when:
>
> - two or more threads in a single process access the same memory location concurrently, and
>
> - at least one of the accesses is for writing, and
>
> - the threads are not using any exclusive locks to control their accesses to that memory.

[Go](https://go.dev/ref/mem#overview):

> A data race is defined as a write to a memory location happening concurrently with another read or write to that same location, unless all the accesses involved are atomic data accesses as provided by the `sync/atomic` package.

[Rust](https://doc.rust-lang.org/nomicon/races.html):

> data races, which are defined as:
>
> - two or more threads concurrently accessing a location of memory
> - one or more of them is a write
> - one or more of them is unsynchronized
