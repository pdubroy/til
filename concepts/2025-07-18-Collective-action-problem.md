# Collective action problem

I was reading [Could AI slow science?](https://www.aisnakeoil.com/p/could-ai-slow-science), and saw this:

> The emphasis on production metrics seems to be worsening over time. Physics Nobel winner Peter Higgs famously noted that he wouldn't even have been able to get a job in modern academia because he wouldn't be considered productive enough.
>
> **So individual researchers' careers might be better off if they are risk averse, but it might reduce the collective rate of progress.**

This seems like a specific instance of a more general concept â€” it's similar to the _prisoner's dilemma_ and the _tragedy of the commons_. So I wondered if there's a more general term for this.

And there is! It's an example of a [collective action problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collective_action_problem):

> A **collective action problem** or **social dilemma** is a situation in which all individuals would be better off cooperating but fail to do so because of conflicting interests between individuals that discourage joint action.
