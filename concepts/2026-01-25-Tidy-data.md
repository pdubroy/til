# Tidy Data

On Friday I took the train from Munich to Brussels, and on the way there, converted my financial planning spreadsheet to a Python script using pandas. Now, on the way back home, I'm reading about [siuba](https://siuba.org) and [dplyr](https://dplyr.tidyverse.org), and I learned about Hadley Wickham's concept of [Tidy Data](https://vita.had.co.nz/papers/tidy-data.pdf):

> Tidy data is a standard way of mapping the meaning of a dataset to its structure. A dataset is messy or tidy depending on how rows, columns and tables are matched up with observations, variables and types. In tidy data:
>
> 1. Each variable is a column; each column is a variable.
> 2. Each observation is a row; each row is an observation.
> 3. Each value is a cell; each cell is a single value.
>
> This is Codd’s 3rd normal form, but with the constraints framed in statistical language, and the focus put on a single dataset rather than the many connected datasets common in relational databases.
