# Simplex

This week I was playing with some Rust optimization libraries, and was investigating derivative-free optimization methods. Two of the algorithms I looked at — [Nelder-Mead][] and [COBYLA][] — work by modeling the candidate solution as a _simplex_.

I'm sure I learned this at some point, but — a simplex is the generalization of a triangle to arbitrary dimensions. Specifically, it's the simplest possible polytope (object with flat sides) in a given dimension. So a 2D simplex (aka a _2-simplex_) is a triangle, and a 3D simplex (_3-simplex_) is a tetrahedron — a triangular pyramid.
