  "alt": "Did you know that HTTP supports requests for a specific range of bytes? I didn't!\n\nI first saw this mentioned a few weeks ago in the Protomaps documentation, and then it came up again in an episode of Developer Voices about DuckDB.\n\nMDN: HTTP range requests:\n\nAn HTTP Range request asks the server to send parts of a resource back to a client. Range requests are useful for various clients, including media players that support random access, data tools that require only part of a large file, and download managers that let users pause and resume a download.\n\nHere's an example:\n\ncurl https://i.imgur.com/z4d4kWk.jpg -i -H \"Range: bytes=0-1023\" --output -\n\n…which issues the following request:\n\nGET /z4d4kWk.jpg HTTP/2\nHost: i.imgur.com\nUser-Agent: curl/8.7.1\nAccept: */*\nRange: bytes=0-1023\nI was kind of surprised that I hadn't heard about this before, but I felt better when I found out that Kris hadn't either :-)"
