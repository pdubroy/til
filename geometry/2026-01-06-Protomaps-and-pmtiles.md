# Protomaps and PMTiles

I spent three years (2018–2020) working on mapping, and haven't followed the space closely since then. So I didn't hear about [Protomaps](https://protomaps.com) when it was announced a few years ago. But, it looks very useful:

> Protomaps enables frontend developers to easily "self-host" maps - it's just a file, no server setup required. It makes serving vector map tiles simple and affordable by using HTTP range requests.

There are more details in the [docs](https://docs.protomaps.com):

> There are three major parts of Protomaps:
>
> - PMTiles, an open archive format for pyramids of tile data, accessible via HTTP Range Requests.
> - An ecosystem of tools and libraries for creating, serving and manipulating PMTiles.
> - A cartographic "basemap" showing features in the world like roads, water bodies and labels, based on the OpenStreetMap dataset, and delivered as one big PMTiles archive.

(And I must say, my first impression is that the docs are very, very good.)
