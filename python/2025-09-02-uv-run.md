# `uv run`

I was looking for a quick way to render some Markdown on the command line, and figured there must be an easy way to do it with [`uv`](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/). And there is:

```sh
echo "import markdown; print(markdown.markdown(open('hello.md').read()))" | uv run --with markdown -
```

I continue to be impressed with all the tools [Astral](https://astral.sh) (creators of `uv`) are building. Really great stuff.
