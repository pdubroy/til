# `uv run`

I was looking for a quick way to render some Markdown on the command line, and figured there must be an easy way to do it with [`uv`](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/). And there is:

```sh
echo "import markdown; print(markdown.markdown(open('hello.md').read()))" | uv run --with markdown -
```

## Declaring script dependencies

If you're running a script from a file, `uv` also lets you declare dependencies via _inline metadata_. Here's the example script from their docs:

```python render_md.py
# /// script
# dependencies = ["markdown"]
# ///
import markdown
print(markdown.markdown(open('hello.md').read()))
```

You could run this via `uv run render_md.py`.

## Using a shebang

You can even using a shebang (`#!`) line to make the file executable:

```python render_md
#!/usr/bin/env -S uv run --script
# /// script
# dependencies = ["markdown"]
# ///
import markdown
print(markdown.markdown(open('hello.md').read()))
```

Then, after doing `chmod +x render_md`, you run it via `./render_md`.

So useful! I continue to be very impressed with all the stuff [Astral](https://astral.sh) (creators of `uv`) are doing.
