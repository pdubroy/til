# PyScript

[PyScript][] is a WebAssembly-based platform for Python in the browser. I first heard about it via Chris Laffra, who's using it in [PySheets][] (an online, Python-based spreadsheet).

PyScript supports two different versions of Python (both are compiled to WebAssembly):

- [Pyodide][] is a version of the standard CPython interpreter, patched to compile to WASM and work in the browser.
- [MicroPython][] is an implementation of Python 3 (including a small subset of the Python standard library) which is optimised to run on microcontrollers.

1. A large red block labeled "User code"
2. Two smaller light green blocks side by side, both labeled "Framework"
3. A dark gray block with "<py-script>" written in white text
4. A blue block at the bottom labeled "Python interpreters compiled to WASM"

The blocks are stacked on top of each other, with the two "Framework" blocks sitting side by side within the "User code" block. The entire diagram is surrounded by a thin white border.](../images/pyscript-platform.png)

[Pyscript.com][] is a web-based IDE for PyScript, Ã  la StackBlitz, Repl.it, etc. Seems like a great way to try out PyScript without having to install anything.

The interface is divided into three main sections: a file explorer on the left showing files like 'index.html', 'main.py', and 'pyscript.toml'; a code editor in the center displaying a single line of Python code 'print("Hello, World!")'; and a preview panel on the right showing the output 'Hello, World!' on a black background](../images/pyscript.com.png)
